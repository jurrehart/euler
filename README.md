Project Euler problems solutions - https://projecteuler.net/about

In this repository I keep my code in C++ for the Euler Project problems.

I do this to master c++ better ,this is during my spare time, I'm no professional programmer so this is not the most elegant code there is but it does the job.

Suggestions & tips are welcome.
